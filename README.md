# Kingdom-animalia
This a program that models the kingdom-Animalia in terms of classification using OOP in Javascript. 
we define a base Kingdom class with a kingdom type, a skeletal structure and a body temperature property, and a name, a type of skeletal structure and a body temperature method that logs the animal's name, skeletal structure and body temperature to the console. We then define seven subclasses for kingdom types of animals. Each of these subclasses extends the Animal class and provides a specific implementation of their property in the constructor using the super keyword to call the base class constructor.

We can then create instances of these classes using the new keyword and call the method on them to see their different properties.
